# Capstone Project

This repository is a template for the capstone project report that is
due as the final assignment of the course. The data for the report was
self-selected by students and submitted during week 3. Some data
cleaning activities were performed by the course instructor, so that
students all have an analysis-ready dataset at hand that follows tidy
data principles and best practices for data organisation in spreadsheets
.
