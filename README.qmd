# Capstone Project

This repository is a template for the capstone project report that is due as the final assignment of the course. The data for the report was self-selected by students and submitted during week 3. Some data cleaning activities were performed by the course instructor, so that students all have an analysis-ready dataset at hand that follows tidy data principles and best practices for data organisation in spreadsheets .

# Directories & Files

The repository has the following directory tree.

```{r}
fs::dir_tree()
```

# Grading

All graded elements are listed and explained on the website for the course.

TODO: Add website URL

# Publishing

It is up to each individual student if they would like to share their final report make their final report public
